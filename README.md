# Hi, I’m Andrew (Makairo)

I’m a **Computer Science graduate** from Arizona State University focused on **backend systems, data structures, and performance-oriented software engineering**.  
I enjoy building things close to the metal: **network servers, custom data structures, and low-level systems code**.

I’m currently strengthening my backend profile by building projects inspired by real-world systems (e.g. Redis-style servers, hash maps, and databases).

## Highlighted Projects

### 🔹 [Adornap-REDIS](https://github.com/Makairo/Adornap-REDIS)
A Redis-style key-value server implemented in C++, created with own hashtable.
Instruction and inspiration taken from 
[build-your-own.org](https://build-your-own.org/redis/#table-of-contents)

### 🔹 [DataStructures (C#)](https://github.com/Makairo/DataStructures)
Collection of data structure implementations demonstrating fundamentals.

### 🔹 [Roulette](https://github.com/Makairo/Roulette)
Small project which simulates a game of the roulette wheel at any casino.

## What I’m Looking For

I’m actively interested in:
- **Backend Software Engineer**
- **Systems / Infrastructure Engineer**
- **Data or Platform Engineering roles**

I’m especially drawn to roles that value:
- Strong fundamentals
- Code quality and correctness
- Understanding *why* systems work, not just how to use frameworks
