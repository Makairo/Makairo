# Hi, I’m Andrew (Makairo)

I’m a **Computer Science graduate** from Arizona State University focused on **backend systems, data structures, and performance-oriented software engineering**.  
I enjoy building things close to the metal: **network servers, custom data structures, and low-level systems code**.

I’m currently strengthening my backend profile by building projects inspired by real-world systems (e.g. Redis-style servers, hash maps, and databases).

### 🔹 [Sudoku](https://github.com/Makairo/Sudoku)
This project implements a playable Sudoku game that runs in the browser.
Players can generate a custom difficulty sudoku board with one unique solution. The browser will congratulate the player on a successful completion!
#### Key Features 

Developed a fully playable, browser-based Sudoku game using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS

Implemented procedural Sudoku board generation with:
- Configurable difficulty levels
- Guaranteed single-solution validation per generated board
- Built real-time input validation logic to prevent illegal moves and maintain board integrity
- Added completion detection and user feedback, congratulating players upon successfully solving a puzzle

### 🔹 [Path Of Solace](https://github.com/Makairo/PathOfSolace)
PathOfSolace is a work-in-progress RogueLite game built in C# using .NET and MonoGame.
Uses C# as the core language, with .NET and MonoGame.
#### Key Features
Designed a modular entity-based architecture, enabling:
- Flexible enemy and player behavior
- Scalable content expansion for items, abilities, and systems
- Implemented grid-based world logic and simulation systems inspired by classic RogueLite design patterns
- Focused on performance-conscious game loops and deterministic mechanics suitable for procedural gameplay

Actively iterating on gameplay systems, balance, and extensibility as part of an ongoing development effort

### 🔹 [Plannro](https://github.com/Makairo/Plannro)
Plannro is a planning and organization tool using Springboot, with Java / HTML / CSS.
Users can create accounts, events, and view events on a visual calendar.
#### Key Features
Designed and implemented user account management, including:
- User-scoped data access for events
- Developed RESTful backend APIs to support event creation and retrieval
- Integrated Hibernate/JPA for ORM-based persistence and relational data modeling
- Implemented role-aware data handling, laying groundwork for per-user event ownership and access control

Debugged and resolved real-world backend challenges, including:
- Spring Security access rules and constraints
- Hibernate entity constraints
- PostgreSQL user permission and sequence management
